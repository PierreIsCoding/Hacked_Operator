# Hacked_Operator
This project helps you to "hack" your own Pocket Operator. However it requires a little bit of checking and hacking on your own behalf. I only tested the PO-20 (Arcade) but I am quite sure all the others will work the same way.


## Disclaimer
Please be careful because you can distroy your Pocket Operator and know that is totally on you own risk ! 

## Tips
- The operator runs on two 1.5V batteries or 3 volt. To keep things simple I have used a ready made converter between my +5V Eurorack and the battery clips. Google for "5 volt to 3.3 volt converter" and you will find many options from cheap suppliers. 
- Don't forget to solder the 3.3volt power and ground to the battery power pins. Look at the photo's for this. I would strongly advice to use a continuity tester to check if you solder the correct pad.
- The pocket operator senses with it female stereo jacks if a male jack is plugged in. Since we don't insert any cables we need to trick the operator. Use wooden tooth picks for both female jacks and play a bit until you feel it pushes the inner spring. See also photos
- You have to solder wires to the 3.5 stereo jacks of the Operator. It is however a bit difficult to see to what pad you have to solder. I would strongly advice to use a continuity tester between all the pads and an inserted stereo cable to see what is what.
